# About 25Embed
25Embed is a tool to prevent your content from being embedded on sites that are not yours.

# History
I first thought of the concept of 25Embed back when I was not so technologically inclined, when I would just embed things into google sites.
I figured there had to be a way to prevent someone from so easily stealing your content, but I didn't know how to create something like that.
Fast forward two years, I have the ability to make something like that so I did.
